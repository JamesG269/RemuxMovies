# RemuxMovies
Remux .MKV, copying video, converting first english audio to .ac3, and removing all other audio and non-english subtitles.

Useful for Sony TV's that run android, since Sony and/or google will not play movies with dtshd or truehd correctly. You will need to store a TMDB.org key in a file at  "c:\users\username\documents\TMDB_API_KEY.txt" for the TMDB scraping to work.
